# hangman
Hangman is a classic word guessing game for one or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters or numbers.

In this project the user will be ask to guess the month of the year, the user will answer this by entering a letter they think is in the word. The program will display a message when the user correctly or incorrectly guesses a letter and display all previously guessed letters so the user doesn't guess them again.
